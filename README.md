# AI Chatbot - Enterprise webpage integration

## Overview
This repository branch is a mix between [enterprise-webpage](https://github.com/E9cipher/enterprise-webpage/) and [AI chatbot](https://github.com/E9cipher/ai_chatbot/). It engages the chatbot integration in webpages.

## If you visited the website and this is what you see
Don't panic! You can:
- Open this page in another browser
- Do a hard refresh (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>P</kbd>).
- If hard refresh doesn't work, [click here](https://e9cipher.github.io/enterprise-webpage/index.html).

## Coding Language
It is coded in HTML, CSS and JS for the frontend, but you can serve this project using the C++ and python files to serve (see backend/ folder). This branch is the one published in gh-pages, so the training UI does not work as github pages only accepts static coding languages.

## Feature
- Customizable sections
- Optimized for performance
- Easy to integrate with DBs
